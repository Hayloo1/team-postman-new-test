Passionate, cross-functional, creative and result-driven marketing personnel with over seven years of marketing experience across digital marketing, product marketing, brand marketing, communications and merchandising. I believe consumer patterns have changed. Sales is no longer about high frequency; it's about connecting with the right recipient at the right time. Gone are the days of being able to cold call a prospective client convincing them that whatever you have to say is more important than what they are doing right now. Clients do not want to be sold. Instead, you must convince them that they need you and your product, but only when they are actually ready to talk. It is important to understand the mind of a customer in this century. 

A few of my core marketing skills are highlighted below:
E-commerce, SEO/SEM strategies
Content building (including sales collateral, blogs)
Social media management
Digital marketing
Customer relationship
Merchandising

 I am currently seeking a managerial position in an organisation that encourages innovative thinking, recognition and career development where my leadership skills will be maximised to achieve business goals. Please contact me if you have such opportunities and feel free to ask any questions you may have about me.

Thanks
